WebCA
=====

WebCA is a Web based Certificate Authority to help you manage your own certificates for development, testing or internal use purposes.

You can generate Self-signed certificates (Certificate Authorities) and server certificates signed by one of those CAs.

If you provide an email account and some email settings, you will be notified when any Certificate is about to expire so you can renew it with a few clicks.
